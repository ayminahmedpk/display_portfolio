Plan:

Simple portfolio. SPA.

Minimalism. Avoid animations and any other toys. Don't play too much with fonts
or obsess over vertical rhythm either.

Design is not the point. Getting it presentable and up there is. Convey
information as cleanly and quickly as possible; but make sure to be cordial.
